# College Portfolio

Here is a small collection of some of the interesting nerdy projects I've done.

## Worldbuilding

I'm currently building a fictional world, with made-up peoples, cultures, languages, and magic. It's mostly an excuse to make up languages, though.

[Here is a link](https://github.com/gamma-delta/conlangs) to a very, very work-in-progress and fairly outdated guide to how to speak Vecinis, my most developed conlang. I'm planning to update and complete it guide at some point. Râk̗ degoti je'ksi, Ekjotk̗n̗ teiki̗ kav̂ Veciniss̗̄... D̄o, d'zi anmaxi̗ âvkes njeko. (If I complete it, the whole world can speak Vecinis... But it won't be very useful.)

## Pokemon Cobalt and Amethyst

I'm on a team of about 100 people working to create a whole new Pokemon game using only unmodded Minecraft, called Pokemon Cobalt and Amethyst. We released a version of it in early 2017, and we're planning on releasing a re-master at some point with the new tools and performance boosts later updates give us.

For the original map, I worked on music, building the map, and creating some of the mechanics. For the planned updated version, I'm also in charge of the development servers.

[Here is a link to the official website.](https://phnixprojects.com/pokeca/) I'm marked down as Gamma in the credits, under Music/SFX Design, Map Building, and Map Engineers.

Cluckalor is no joke.

## The Omega Network

This is probably my most ambitious project yet.

The Omega Network is a tabletop RPG I'm developing about hacking. The game takes place in two halves: there are some Operatives inside the building doing more traditional RPG stuff, like sneaking around and fighting guards. For the other half, one or two Hackers use their laptops to hack things through a terminal-like interface that runs in the browser.

I'm hoping to continue development of The Omega Network through the school year. I've put in a proposal for it to be an Independent Art project. 

[Here is a link](https://github.com/gamma-delta/HackSlashRun) to an earlier version of the game (Hack Slash Run was a temporary name). It is playable, but it has a lot of really awful flaws (such, the Hackers can just read the javascript file served to them and get all the passwords). Still, the concept is there.

At some point, I'd like to be able to sell this game. I'm not sure if it can happen, but of all my projects, I think this one has the best shot.
